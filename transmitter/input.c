/* The different ways to get pointer focus on a remoted surface:
 *
 * 1. Transmitter seat has pointer. The client has wl_pointer. Transmitter
 *    receives pointer.enter. (transmitter_seat_pointer_enter())
 *
 * 2. Transmitter seat has pointer. Transmitter has received pointer.enter.
 *    The client calls wl_seat.get_pointer. => send enter only on the new
 *    wl_pointer. (seat_get_pointer_handler())
 *
 * 3. Client has wl_pointer. Transmitter seat adds pointer capability.
 *    Transmitter receives pointer.enter. wl_pointer MUST NOT enter,
 *    specified by wl_seat.capabilities.
 *
 * By definition, Transmitter cannot receive pointer.enter without having
 * pointer capability in the seat, so no other combinations are possible.
 *
 * The same applies to wl_keyboard and wl_touch.
 */

/* Implementor notes:
 *
 * The handling of all of wl_pointer, wl_keyboard and wl_touch should be
 * similar. To make it work, we need to add a signal to each of the
 * wl_seat.get_pointer, wl_seat.get_keyboard, and wl_seat.get_touch request
 * handlers in Weston core. Otherwise we cannot implement the case 2 of gaining
 * input device focus.
 *
 * However, weston_keyboard::focus is a weston_surface, not a weston_view, so
 * we may be able to leverage more of the core implementation and maybe do
 * without the wl_seat.get_keyboard signal. Weston_touch uses a weston_view, so
 * that is similar to weston_pointer.
 *
 * It might be useful to convert weston_keyboard and weston_touch to use a
 * similar thing as weston_pointer_client, in case it makes things more
 * consistent. It might also fix issues when a client has multiple copies of a
 * wl_keyboard or a wl_touch, but that is getting off-topic.
 *
 * This file shows which part of the Weston input path we skip and where we
 * hook in. We skip everything starting from the notify_*() API used by
 * backends, and stub out the grab handlers. Instead of actual grab handlers,
 * we have our own network protocol events handlers. They do much of the same
 * as normal grab handlers would do, except focus is pre-given, and we do not
 * have weston_view for the focus surfaces, so we need to bypass core code
 * dealing with those.
 *
 * Our remote seat implementation will leave many struct members unused and
 * replicate some from weston_pointer, weston_keyboard, and weston_touch.
 * Weston core must be kept out from the focus handling business, because we
 * will send enter/leave events ourselves, and focus assignments are given
 * to us from the remote, they cannot be changed at will by the local Weston.
 */

/** Callback from the protocol request handler for wl_seat.get_pointer
 *
 * The Weston core handler never sees focus set on the weston_pointer,
 * so it won't send wl_pointer.enter nor set focus_client. It does call
 * weston_pointer_ensure_pointer_client() though.
